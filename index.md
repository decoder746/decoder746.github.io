<!-- I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Emory University](http://emory.edu/) in December 2012 with a specialization in Computational Mathematics (high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, image processing, inverse problems, and numerical analysis), with [Prof. Alessandro Veneziani](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~ale)([Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/)) serving as my principal advisor.

I completed my postdoctoral training at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC)](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://llnl.gov/) (February 2013 - February 2015), working with [Dr. Panayot Vassilevski](http://people.llnl.gov/vassilevski1) on algebraic multigrid and numerical upscaling techniques with applications to flow in porous media. After completing my postdoc, I joined the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](http://oden.utexas.edu/) of [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu/) (March 2015-July 2018) as a Reseach Associate, working with [Prof. Omar Ghattas](http://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar) on scalable numerical methods for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems, uncertainty quantification and propagation, optimal experimental design, and optimization under uncertainty.<br><br>

After spending four years as a Research Assistant Professor of [Electrical and Systems Engeneering (ESE)](https://ese.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu) and member of the [PhD in Imaging Science Faculty](https://engineering.wustl.edu/departments-faculty/interdisciplinary-degree-programs/imaging-science/Pages/default.aspx), I rejoined the Oden Institute in the August 2022 as a Research Scientist working at the interface of imaging science and predictive scientific computing.<br>

I obtained my B.Tech with honors in Computer Science and minors in Applied Statistics and Informatics from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in May 2021. I completed my B.Tech Project under Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan and Prof. Soumen Chakraborty on the topics of Video Summarization and Extreme classification.

From May 2021 to August 2022 I worked at Microsoft as a Data and Applied Scientist in the Bing Ads team, where we worked on creating new image and text models to replace the legacy models for detecting policy compliance for ads

Currently I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at UT Austin and am working on Audio Visual Navigation under Prof. Kristen Graumann.
